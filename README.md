# Data Structures

This is a personal repository of me trying to implement data structures and algorithms in Rust from the Book "Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy: Data Structures and Algorithms Puzzles by Narasimha Karumanchi". My only goal is to learn more about Rust Programming Language and data structures.
